                    <p>Design runs deeper than the aesthetics and includes systems, institutions and services. It is inherently social, collaborative and inclusive and no longer an activity limited to designers in the confines of a studio.</p>
                    <p>We believe that design includes the material as well as the non-material.</p>
                    <p>Similar to first impressions: the suit, the smile, and how one talks - design is the first impression of a company. This encompasses not just the logo, the brand, the service and the people behind it. Our role is to communicate the company's message to the right audience successfully.</p>

                    <p>Prior to setting up Komunity Design we asked ourselves how we could aid the little blue planet in our own way. During the pandemic we got to work and set up bases in Malaysia and Singapore in order to reach and connect with those that could assist and those that needed support. After working with companies through branding, packaging and website development we realized that if everyone were to play a part, the strength of the community would amplify the positive change.</p>
                    <p>From community work to environmental projects we would look at all the possible avenues that would benefit society.</p>
