#### Motivation

Early 2021 when Malaysia and Singapore started rolling out vaccinations there are some who expressed a hesitancy to receive the COVID-19 vaccine. We wanted to find out why seemingly rational people were resistant to an obvious solution to a global problem.

In the past, vaccination acceptance has relied on the trust that people have in physicians, nurses, and pharmacists. But recently that re-assuring face-to-face contact between health care providers and the public has been attenuated, partly because so much medicine is practiced virtually, as a safeguard against exposure to the virus. That places more responsibility on everyone else. We can counter misinformation not only by electing political representatives who favor pro-vaccination health policies but also by communicating with people in our local communities, where much of the discussion about health matters takes place.

As part of our efforts to reach out to the community, we created an [informal online survey](/https://vaccination.komunity.design/) on our website to try to uncover possible reasons people in our community are hesitant towards getting the COVID-19 Vaccine.

We hoped to understand the different positions people held on the COVID-19 vaccination.

This survey is part of our research to uncover possible reasons people in our community are hesitant towards getting the COVID-19 Vaccine. We were curious why the registration rates for the vaccination were relatively low in Malaysia. We hope that our findings can provide insight to individuals and caregivers to better communicate the importance of vaccination.

The initial question of the survey serves as a screening mechanism to categorize 
the participants into **4 different groups**:



| 1. I will get vaccinated when it is offered to me. 	| (Pro-vaccination)  |
| 2. I do not intend to get vaccinated.			  		| (Anti-Vaccination) |
| 3. I am hesitant to get myself vaccinated.		  	| (Hesitant)         |
| 4. I don't really care about the vaccination.	  		| (Apathy)           |


As the primary objective of the survey was to discover the possible reasons people 
are hesitant to receive the vaccine, we were most interested in the data collected 
from participants in Groups 2 and 3.

Participants from Group 1 (Pro-vaccination) were also asked to predict the reasons 
others might be hesitant to take the vaccine.
